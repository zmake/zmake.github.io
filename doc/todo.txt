1. write documentation

2. minor issues to maybe fix:
assert there aren't two files of the same name in the same project, or fix the obj output directory structure (MSVC)
assert there aren't two projects of the same name in the solution
parse 'token}' as two tokens
handle this error better: '"Win"32"'
test parse failure scenarios
test can't write to file (read-only) scenario
inherit zmake-config parameters from parent config file
if a file will be written, report relevant changes (added file X, removed file Y)
