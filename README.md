WHAT IS ZMAKE?

zmake is a build system generator like CMake or SCons, but designed to be light-weight. Its opt-out file enumeration enables a compilation unit to be added by simply creating the file.


WHAT DOES IT DO?

zmake is intended to run as a pre-build step. It recurses your source directories and overwrites out of date vcxproj and Makefiles.


WHAT DOES IT NOT DO?

zmake does not manage compiler options. Instead its autogenerated vcxproj files import zmake_base.props and either zmake_exe.props, zmake_lib.props, or zmake_dll.props. Its autogenerated Makefiles include zmake_top.mk and zmake_base.mk. users choose their platform specific compiler options.


HOW DO I CONFIGURE IT?

zmake-config.ztxt is the global settings file. The complete list of parameters is defined in src/zmake/Config.cpp (look for WTON_MEMBER)

Individual directories may include parameter overrides with a file named zmake.ztxt. The complete list of overrideable parameters is defined in src/zmake/ProjectData.cpp (look for WTON_MEMBER)
