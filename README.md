zmake.github.io
===============

zmake is a build system generator like CMake or SCons, but designed to be light-weight. Its opt-out file enumeration enables a compilation unit to be added by simply creating the file. It also enables filenames and directories to define which configurations they should be compiled for.

WHAT DOES IT DO?

zmake is intended to run as a pre-build step for make or Visual Studio. It recurses your source directories and overwrites out of date vcxproj and Makefiles.

Generated Makefile example: https://github.com/zmake/zmake.github.io/blob/master/src/zmake/Makefile

Generated vcxproj example: https://github.com/zmake/zmake.github.io/blob/master/.zproj/.%20zmake.vcxproj


WHAT DOES IT NOT DO?

zmake does not manage compiler options. Instead its autogenerated vcxproj files import zmake_base.props and either zmake_exe.props, zmake_lib.props, or zmake_dll.props. Its autogenerated Makefiles include zmake_top.mk and zmake_base.mk. users choose their platform specific compiler options.


HOW DO I CONFIGURE IT?

zmake-config.ztxt is the global settings file. The complete list of parameters is defined in src/zmake/Config.cpp (look for WTON_MEMBER)

Individual directories may include parameter overrides with a file named zmake.ztxt. The complete list of overrideable parameters is defined in src/zmake/ProjectData.cpp (look for WTON_MEMBER)

zmake is built with zmake. Look at its examples directory for many use cases.
